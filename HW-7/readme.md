# HW 7 | Describe then Alter the Bouncing Ball

## Description of What the Original Code is Doing

<!--
--This is a Comment Block--

Please describe what the original code is doing.

Why is it working the way it is?
What does each line do?
How can you make the ball change direction?

-->
The code works as follows:
1. The ball's characteristics are first defined by the variables, which determine its radius, starting position, and intended movements across the screen;
2. The canvas' size and color is determined within the function(setup) designation;
3. The ball's movements across the screen are assigned under the function(draw) designation, further detailed by the "if" statements that outline the conditions of the movements;
4. The ball changes direction according to the assigned positioning state and conditionality of the function mousePressed() operation, which changes the ball's movements based on whether or not the mouse is clicked.



## How did you alter the sketch?

<!--
Please describe how and why you changed the sketch?
-->
I altered the sketch to change the background color using the random operation because I felt it needed more variation; I then changed the movement of the ball to 20 frames and eliminated the drag effect to make it more visually consistent, and then added Boolean code to create a new ellipse and change its color according to the conditional statements, so as to practice using the code and to add more images to the composition.
