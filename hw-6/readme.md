# Week 6 HW README

## Work Cycle
---
For this week's homework, I decided to combine the elements we went over on the website and combine them into a flashy, abstract piece of algorithm art.

## Steps Taken
---
To complete this assignment, I performed several tasks:
- I read along in the tutorials;
- I constructed the flashing canvas;
- I set up the moving shapes and;
- modified the code to get rid of any bugs or other issues

## Issues
---
I did encounter an issue at first with getting implementing the "abs()" code operation into the code, but was able to figure out how and where to place it after some play and experimentation.

## What I Learned
---
I learned a lot in this assignment, and while I was doing additional research, I read a lot about the use of array code that I am interestd in using further.
