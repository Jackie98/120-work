["Hello World!" Sketch](https://jackie98.github.io/120-work/hw-3/)
## This Week in Review:
---
This week I learned about how to set up and use sketch.js files in conjuction with the index.html files.

## Steps to Complete
---
For this assignment, I:
* Created a sample of the "Hello World!" file;
* Used the empty-example folder to make the hw-3 directory;
* Followed along to learn the functions necessary to create art in sketch.js;
* Launched my livesite on Github.
## Issues
---
The only issue I experienced was coordinating my index.html file with my sketch.js file, due to me changing the name of my repository halfway though the assignment and causing a disconnection, but I was able to remedy that through some trial and error!

## What I learned
---
I had no idea that p5.js existed! And it was so intriguing to watch their introductory video. So I learned that coding can actually be a lot of fun and produce some truly inventive interactive art!
