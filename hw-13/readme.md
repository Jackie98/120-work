# Proposal
---
I'd like to create an interactive garden, where the user can "touch" the plants and watch how they react/grow; I think it would also be great to possibly include a short soubndtrack, if possible.

# Inspiration
---
My inspiration for this work comes from some vaporwave art/"lo-fi" music I frequently listen to on Youtube; I was also particularly inspired by the firefly art example on the coding website.

# Problems
---
I currently do not yet know how to code music into a sketch, so I will need to research how to do so.

# Work Plan
---
Ideally, I would like to set aside an hour each day beginning Monday, November 26, to work on and complete my sketch; I will most likely set alarm reminders for myself on my phone to keep track of when I need to work on the project, and how much time I have left to do so.

# Current Work
---
I have already begun researching some ideas for aesthetics and how-to's on coding music into a sketch.
